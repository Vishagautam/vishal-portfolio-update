                    <div>As many of you may know, I have been involved in Competitive Programming for a very long time,
                        and while preparing for those contests, I didn&#x27;t spend any of my time on actual projects.
                        Lately, I thought that it would be a good time to branch out and try out stuff that I
                        haven&#x27;t done before.</div>
                    <div>Now I have to admit, I have done a bit of web development before I went into CP, but it was
                        barely anything. I had some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript (and JQuery,
                        remember when that was still a thing?). However, I didn&#x27;t really spend much time and the
                        stuff I made looked like they were from a time before I was even born.</div>
                    <div>So I basically time-traveled 6 years into the future. I look around the web development
                        ecosystem, and there are all these new frameworks which I have never heard of before. And it
                        seems like a lot of technologies like PHP have disappeared! There&#x27;s also all this hype
                        around NoSQL and Serverless Functions.</div>
                    <div>There is way too much to learn, so I decided to just stick with frontend stuff at first. I was
                        recommended <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                            class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 transition" href="https://reactjs.org">React</a>
                        and I thought it was a pretty good idea because knowledge in React directly transferred over to
                        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 transition"

                        all at once.</div>
                    <div>After going through <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                            class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 transition"
                            href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">the tutorial</a>, I realized that the way
                        that React forms Apps out of these Components is pretty cool, and it felt like the
                        object-oriented nature of Java applied to the JavaScript I was using before on my webpages.
                    </div>
                    <div>I made a personal page (which I didn&#x27;t end up uploading because I didn&#x27;t like it that
                        much) and that was about it. I didn&#x27;t do much since I was struggling for hours on CSS
                        formatting and I had schoolwork to take care of.</div>
                    <div>After that, I played around with React Native and didn&#x27;t make much either.</div>
                    <div>On 12/17/20, I was searching up random frameworks (trying to get an idea of what they do) and I
                        stumbled across <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                            class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 transition" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>.
                        The stuff it was able to do seemed pretty cool. Vercel (the creator of Next.js) gave SSL for
                        free and it seemed really simple to make some simple backend stuff happen so I decided to make
                        this website with Next.js.</div>
                    <div>I decided that <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

                        use the icons that Bootstrap provide.</div>

                        YouTube channel (I did too much work for this but I did learn a lot). There was more complexity
                        in the React components, and I also had to learn a bit of Firebase for my database.</div>
                    <div>I spent some time after that working on my Discord bot, then I came back and decided that I
                        should create a blog, so here we are now.</div>

Shortly after, I was threatened by my friend to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead so I switched. I still continue to use the icons that Bootstrap provide.\n\nAs a fun exercise, I decided to make a [voting page](/200kvote) for my YouTube channel (I did too much work for this but I did learn a lot). There was more complexity in the React components, and I also had to learn a bit of Firebase for my database.\n\nI spent some time after that working on my Discord bot, then I came back and decided that I should create a blog, so here we are now.\n",
